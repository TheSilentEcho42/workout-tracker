## Tips for Effective Tracking

### 1. Be Consistent

- Track every workout, even if it's shorter than planned
- Consistency in tracking helps you see real progress over time

### 2. Use RIR (Reps in Reserve) Accurately

RIR helps track training intensity:
- **0 RIR**: Maximum effort - use sparingly
- **1-2 RIR**: Ideal for strength building
- **3-4 RIR**: Good for volume and muscle building
- **5+ RIR**: Too easy - consider increasing weight

### 3. Track Everything

Don't skip tracking:
- Bodyweight exercises (use 0 or leave weight empty)
- Warm-up sets (optional, but helpful for reference)
- Failed sets (still valuable data)

### 4. Review Your History Regularly

- Check your progress weekly
- Identify patterns (e.g., "I always struggle on Mondays")
- Celebrate improvements (new PRs, increased volume)

### 5. Use AI Summaries

After completing workouts, the AI can generate:
- **Strengths**: What you did well
- **Improvements**: Areas to focus on
- **Next Steps**: Recommendations for future workouts

### 6. Plan Ahead

- Save workout plans for your routine
- Plan your week in advance
- Adjust plans based on how you feel

### 7. Stay Honest

- Record actual performance, not what you planned
- If you did 8 reps instead of 10, record 8
- Accurate data leads to better insights
